The <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Coding+Webhook+Plugin">coding-webhook</a> has a web hook trigger that can be used to notify Jenkins when a push has occurred and that a build should also happen. <br/> By enabling this permission you grant anonymous external READ access to the <b>/coding/*</b> URL so that the request can be received.

The <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Coding+Webhook+Plugin">coding-webhook</a> checks that a change has actually occurred so this should be safe to enable.
